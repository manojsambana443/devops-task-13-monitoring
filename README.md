# Task 13 – Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Objective
To monitor system metrics using Prometheus and visualize them using Grafana.

## Tools Used
- Prometheus
- Node Exporter
- Grafana
- Linux (WSL)

## Implementation Steps
1. Installed and configured Prometheus
2. Installed Node Exporter to expose system-level metrics
3. Configured Prometheus to scrape Node Exporter metrics
4. Added Prometheus as a data source in Grafana
5. Imported Node Exporter Full dashboard
6. Performed CPU load testing and observed metric changes

## Observations
- CPU usage increased during stress testing
- Metrics were visualized in real time in Grafana
- Prometheus follows a pull-based monitoring model

## Learning Outcome
Gained hands-on experience with monitoring, metrics collection, and visualization.
